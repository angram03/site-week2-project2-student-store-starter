# Student Store Project

Selling merchandise in the modern era requires digital solutions. For this project, you'll be tasked with designing and constructing an online student store for the College of CodePath. The web app consists of a frontend user interface for potential customers to browse available goods and a backend API to handle data management. The API will be built with Node and Express, and the UI will be built with React.

Check out our [deployed Student Store](https://codepath-student-store-demo.surge.sh/) for reference! Explore the exemplar by trying the following tasks:

- Click on the different categories (clothing, food, etc.) to filter the list of products.
- Search for an existing product.
- Search for a product that doesn't exist.
- Add several products to the shopping cart.
- Checkout and view the final receipt.

## *Week 2* Application Features

### Core Features

- [x] The website displays header, banner, search, product grid, about, contact, and footer section.
- [x] The website displays the products at the [GET /store endpoint](https://codepath-store-api.herokuapp.com/store) on initial page load.
- [x] Users can click on a category (clothing, food, etc.) to filter the product grid by type.
- [x] Users can search for products.
- [x] User can click on a product in the grid to navigate to a new page containing additional product details.

Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

It was overall challenging. I'm still trying to figure out "routing". It is a hard concept to grasp. 

If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I would have included the side bar as well as the shopping cart. I really want to get there by the end of this program. If I build a store, I am for sure going to strive and work hard to add similar features like that one. 

Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Yes! Everything went well now that I have been working on it even more. There were so many things I had to work on, but everything is great! I wish I still had more time to add other features, but I do plan on adding more stuff in the future! :D




I am going to resubmit this. I understand there are a lot of core features missing. I am also planning to add stretch features. I was having a rough time understanding this project and the things I learned, so I didn't want to rush myself just to submit it. I want to grasp the material.  I did however push myself a lot and I progressed. So like i mentioned, a resubmission is coming ASAP.

Update: Hello! I am resubmitting this! I finally finished. I got help from my peers (Habeebah especially) and the instructors. Thank you so much Ronesha and Habeebah!!! You can now search for the products, click the product for details, and the navbar is working. The links work and take you to the certain components you want to go to! I also have categories and they work!!!

### Week 3 Updates
I am planning to resubmit! I still have to implement the rest of the core features, but they rely on the shopping cart which is still something I am trying to understand.
